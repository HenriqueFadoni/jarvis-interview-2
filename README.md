# Javis Second Interview

## Thought Process

First of all, I started by quick drawing the functionalities and steps that the application would have.
Second of all, I made a quick sketch about the process it would work and how it you save and use data.
Last but not least, I wrote the steps I would take to conclude the small features.

## Notes

I have chosen to use some functions out of the component's scope to better optimize the application. Must of the functions in the main functionalities were been called too many time even though when they weren't needed. And, I opt for this approach instead of using unnecessary react hook to try to handle it.

## How to run?

Download the application and use the basic commands: `npm install` and `npm start` to visualise the project.
